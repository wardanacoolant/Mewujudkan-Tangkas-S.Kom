# Project "Mewujudkan Tangkas, S.Kom"

This is a repository related to the project to realize "Tangkas, S.Kom".

## Background

Our friend, Tangkas, experienced difficulties while working on his thesis. As a dignified friend, Hendra and I decided to help him. It so happened that we were in the same class at the Informatics Study Program. The difference is, Hendra has passed the thesis examination, I am going to the thesis examination, while Tangkas is just starting the thesis.

## Aim

It's very clear, which is realizing the S.Kom title on Tangkas.

## Benefits

Helped realize Mr. Suhar's vision, which wanted to "graduate the 2016 generation on time".
